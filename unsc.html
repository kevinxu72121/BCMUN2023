        <p>The primary institution in charge of preserving world peace and security is the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The UNSC, which has 15 members including 5 permanent members with veto power, is essential in reacting to international crises and conflicts. At Model United Nations, you will get the chance to represent a member state and take part in spirited discussions, negotiations, and diplomacy to tackle some of the most important global issues. The UNSC committee offers delegates a distinctive and demanding opportunity to strengthen their leadership, critical thinking, and public speaking abilities while obtaining a greater understanding of international politics and diplomacy, from crisis management to peacekeeping operations.</p>
        <p>This committee is open to delegates of all skills; however, is more suited for advanced delegates. The UNSC is limited to 15 delegates. Position Papers are mandatory for this committee.</p>

                        <p>A rising senior at Southpointe, Jimmy is distinctly honoured to serve as the director of UNSC. Ever since attending his first conference at the start of Grade 8, Jimmy has been deeply immersed within the whirlwind of enriching experiences offered by Model United Nations - from political discourse to debate to international relationship. Outside of MUN, Jimmy can be spotted intensely following the NBA, binging another anime series (recommendations needed), and hanging out with friends.

Since starting his first conference not knowing what a "motion" was, he would have never expected the years of fiery speeches, near-comedic discussions, and organized chaos that would follow. Tim expresses his deepest gratitude to the world of Model United Nations, and the indelible impact it has had on his recent years. When not engaged in MUN, you can find him watching food reviews, reading up on NBA statistics, or being consumed alive by the IB program. Tim hopes that UNSC will be a memorable committee, and looks forward to meeting everyone in November.</p>

Outside of Model UN, Sara can be found attempting to find the motivation to complete her stack of assignments, going on long walks in her community, or shooting arrows in a nearby park. Sara looks forward to BCMUN 2023 and the debates that are bound to come.</p>
