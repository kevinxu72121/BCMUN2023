        <p>With our historic crisis committee at Model UN, take a trip back in time and explore the world of historic crisis management. As a member of this committee, you will be taken back in time to a particular historical event, such as a significant political negotiation or world event. You'll collaborate with other delegates to make crucial decisions and work through challenging issues in a dynamic setting. You'll draw on your historical familiarity and diplomatic prowess to resolve conflicts amicably. Delegates can immerse themselves in the past and learn more about world history through the historic crisis committee, which also helps them develop their leadership, critical thinking, and public speaking skills. Are you ready to make your mark on the world?</p>
        <p>This committee is open to delegates of all skills; however, is more suited for advanced delegates. HCC is limited to 20 delegates this year. Position Papers are mandatory for this committee.</p>

                        <p>Matthew is a first year student at Simon Fraser University and is delighted to be serving as your Director for the Historical Crisis Committee. Ever since first stumbling into the world of Model United Nations, Matthew has found himself enthralled by the fast paced and contentious environment, and is excited to delve headfirst into his next committee! Some of his interests include fencing, reading, long walks throughout the evening, and long philosophical conversations that lead to nothing at all. Matthew is hopeful that your Model United Nations experience will be fruitful, and the lessons you learn will last a lifetime. With eager anticipation, Matthew looks forward to meeting you all at BCMUN 2023.</p>

                        <p>Alex is a grade 11 student at Steveston London and is beyond ecstatic to be the chair of HCC at this iteration of BCMUN. Since attending BCMUN in 2022 Alex has been captivated by the conference for its incredible professionalism and extraordinary staff. He was initially forced into MUN by his friends in grade 9 but fell in love with the hilarious committee moments, the humorous speeches, and the lively debate. Outside MUN, he finds joy in lifting heavy circular objects, and procrastinating on anything possible. Alex wishes all delegates a delightful experience and looks forward to seeing everyone in November.</p>

                        <p>A sophomore at Crofton House School, Sissi is delighted to serve as the Assistant Director of the Historical Crisis Committee for BCMUN 2023. Having long been fascinated by the effects of seemingly distant world affairs on her life as a mere teenager, Sissi initially embarked on the tumultuous journey of a MUN career to investigate further into the labyrinth of international debate. However, what she thought would be formal, decorous conference meetings have never been short of outlandish jokes and lively conversations over ramen at midnight. From sitting through her first committee without raising her placard once to screaming openly at other delegates in the middle of the room, Sissi is eternally grateful for all the growth MUN has brought to her. For this iteration of the Historical Crisis Committee, she keenly awaits meeting the delegates and becoming one - of the hopefully many - people they befriend on their own journeys in MUN.</p>
